	Statistical analysis on the Iris Dataset (prediction-based tests)
  Performance evaluation based on precisoin and accuracy metric.
	1) Logistic Regression
	2) Decision Tree Classifier
	3) K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm	
	4) Linear Discriminant Analysis
	5) Gaussian Naive Bayes
	6) Support Vector Machines

	Note: 1) Dataset split into Training Set, Validation Set.
	      2) K-folds Cross Validation technique applied.
